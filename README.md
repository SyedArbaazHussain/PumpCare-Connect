## Overview

PumpCare Connect aims to simplify the process of monitoring and controlling water pumps through a user-friendly interface. This system collects data from sensors attached to pumps, analyzes performance, and predicts failures, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal efficiency. The platform is scalable, making it suitable for small farms to large industrial operations.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: View live data on pump status, energy consumption, and other critical metrics.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Advanced analytics to predict potential failures before they happen.
- **Remote Control**: Remotely start, stop, and configure pumps via a web interface or mobile app.
- **Historical Data**: Track performance over time and generate reports for analysis.
- **Alert System**: Get notified via email/SMS when critical thresholds are met.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: mysql
- **IoT Integration**: MQTT protocol for sensor communication
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS
- **Analytics**: Python (for predictive maintenance and data analytics)
